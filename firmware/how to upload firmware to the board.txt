Follow instructions in the website below to install firmware to the minitronics board,
http://reprap.org/wiki/Minitronics_10

 but don't use the latest version of marlin software,

use the one in this folder instead.

If the last version used from the website, minitronics board is not recognized.

the board is in com4

loaded the .ino file in:
C:\Granta\reprap\minitronicstest

and connected board fan, x & y stepper mottors.

uploaded the test to the board, and both motors are moving. The fan works.

copied marlin.pde from wrong marlin firmware above to customized working one. The file didn't exist in the right folder

This didn't make any difference.

Had to tweak configuration.h to invert the limits of all axis/endstops.

Had to invert the soldering for endstop cabling, the switches were always on, preventing moving of motors
